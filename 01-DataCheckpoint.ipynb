    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed and released in 2020 by Riot Games, VALORANT is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter game with 28 playable agents divided into 4 different roles–duelist, initiator, controller, sentinel–as of February 2026. Players select “agents” prior to the start of the match, with teams switching between attacking and defending “sites” halfway through the game. “Site” refers to an area on the map where the attacking team needs to plant the objective, otherwise known as the “spike,” and the defending team needs to prevent it from being planted or defuse it before it explodes after a certain amount of time. “Agents” are playable characters, each with unique abilities that complement the different roles: \n",
    "- Duelists: Excel at “entry fragging.” Basically, they are agents that are best known for initial fights and entering sites. Their abilities are often movement abilities or defensive utilities meant for getting kills to help their team enter the site and plant the bomb.\n",
    "- Initiators: Information gatherers. These agents' utilities help their team find where the enemies are positioning or even hiding. Additionally, their kit comes with abilities that help the team further fight enemies at an advantage, such as flashes or stuns. Flashing refers to blinding enemies, and stunning refers to a short debuff that impairs movement, gunfire rate, and shaky camera movement for the player to simulate dizziness. Both of these factors may increase a player’s probability of winning a gunfight with their opponent.\n",
    "- Controllers: Strategic agents that utilize their abilities to assist teammates and manipulate the battlefield, which involves the map, enemy positions, and actions. These abilities include walls and smokes, which help block out enemies and help their team take space on site. Walls and smokes are temporary barriers that block the enemy’s line of sight, but not a solid barrier, so they can still walk through them or enemies can also wait for them to disappear after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "- Sentinels: Site defenders and bombsite anchors. Sentinels are the agents who help secure the sites for their team. They excel at stalling enemy pushes–whether it be delaying an enemy attack from behind or delaying the enemy team from taking full control of a site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to win 13 rounds by attacking and defending your site using gunplay and abilities. A core mechanic in gunplay is the headshot. While each gun deals a different amount of damage to the head, something unique to Valorant is that when both teams are on equal buy, meaning they have the same amount of money, most guns only require a single bullet to the head to instantly kill an opponent. This makes headshot percentage a key measurement of individual mechanical skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "VALORANT Champion Tour (VCT) is an annual tournament hosted by Riot Games. It features four regional leagues, Americas, EMEA, Pacific, and China. VCT events are divided into regional leagues and international leagues. Regional leagues refer to the four regions as mentioned previously while international leagues refer to Masters or Champions events. In other words, the international leagues consist of top teams that won their regional games and the one team that wins is considered the best team in the world as of that year. Since there are many different levels of tournaments and stages, for this project, we will be focusing on VCT Challengers playoff games from 2024-2025. We decided to leave out games from previous stages since the playoffs stage involves top teams, where winners advance to the grand finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a viewer's perspective, each region has different play styles. Regions like EMEA may play very strategically while other regions like to ‘run it down,’ or in other words, play more aggressively. With 18 unique guns to buy from and 28 different agents to choose from, we thought it would be interesting to explore how headshot rates and agent pick rates affect win percentages across different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research matters because VCT playoffs represent the highest level of competitive Valorant. The prize pools for these international events exceed a million dollars annually. With any kind of sport, successful teams will attract huge sponsorship deals and brand partners. Understanding certain features that establish a successful team can help improve future games and coaching decisions. It might even shine light on any adjustments necessary for improving game balance by showing us whether certain playstyles or agents have a possible disproportionate competitive advantage. In addition, regional playstyle differences may reveal how gameplay is tied to cultural differences and practice environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "One study that has been done related to our topic is Valorant Analysis: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). As suggested by the title, the author compared the performances between different machine learning models trained on Valorant data. More specifically, they compared these models to determine which is the best at revealing underlying patterns and predicting outcomes in a \"high-stakes gaming environment.\" The author used a Kaggle dataset on a player's first 1000 Valorant games (not their own games). They performed basic EDA and created data visualizations to understand visual patterns across different variables like agent pick distributions, rank distribution, map frequency, wins/losses, and KDA (kills, deaths, assists) metrics. Afterwards, they trained an XGB (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model and an RF (Random Forest) model. When comparing metrics&mdash;accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, class 0 performance, weight average&mdash;between the two models, they found that the RF model performed slightly better in terms of precision and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study, titled Valorant VCT Challengers 2024 Analysis, has actually been done on a dataset we may consider using<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The author first preprocessed the data by renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values. Going into EDA, they looked into region and agent distribution, and then they visualized selected columns as a density histogram. Afterward, they looked into the top 1% of players with the highest rating in the tournament and top 1% of agents played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last study we were able to find related to our topic is the VCT 2024 Agent Composition Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This analysis has also been done on a different dataset we consider using for this project. The author preprocessed their data through feature engineering, renaming columns, and did some basic exploration where they looked at descriptive summary statistics for: number of matches played per tournament, stage distribution, match type distribution, and number of matches played per map. They also visualized win rates between agent picks, maps, and they applied a regression model to see if meta agent picks have an impact on win probability and a prediction model on whether map and agent pick influences win probability. Lastly, they created a recommendation list of agents based on win rate and pick rate for each map, which was very interesting to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three studies mentioned above explores individual performance and agent compositions separately. None have examined how the interactions between mechanical skill (headshot percentage) and strategic choices (agent compositions) vary across the different regions in VCT. Additionally, the existing studies primarily focus on descriptive analysis rather than predictive modeling and do not specifically analyze any regional playstyle differences. Our project differs from other studies as it:\n",
    "1. Examines the interaction between headshot percentage and agent picks\n",
    "2. Compares how results vary across the four major VCT regions and to what extent\n",
    "3. Uses playoff data from two consecutive years\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation we found from the first prior work is related to the dataset they used for analysis. From Kaggle, they used a dataset titled My First 1000 Valorant Games, where the dataset author used the data gathered from their own account. With that said, the analyses that were done in the article are not generalizable to the Valorant population as the machine learning models were applied to analyze one player’s account out of millions of others. They also did not explain how their findings were important and focused more on how the models they used differed from one another in terms of metrics. It was also a bit unclear what variables were being used as inputs for the machine learning, especially more so if you do not know how to read code. We will address this kind of limitation by being clear about information that might be missing from our dataset and how they affect our conclusion findings, and also creating markdown cells to explain our work in detail so our reader does not feel lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation can be found in the second prior work, where their data visualization in comparing 4 different columns–rating, KAST (kills, assists, survived, traded), headshot percentage, clutch success percentage–overlaps one another. This makes the graph hard for the reader to interpret even when there’s a short caption explaining all but one plot appears normally distributed. We would address this type of limitation in our project by making sure our plots are easily understandable and so we can reduce cognitive overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last limitation we found is in the third study, which also relates to some of their data visualizations. For example, when looking into the win rates per agent, the author chose to give their bar graph a diverging color scheme when it is unnecessary. This is considered a limitation because it may contribute to cognitive overload since the colors do not provide any significant meaning. The interpretation of the graph would be the same if all the bars were one single color. This color scheme is more suited for visualizations such as a correlation heatmap, which is a graph they do have in their study. But for a bar graph, a diverging color scheme is not needed. We will address this type of limitation in our project by using colors wisely in our data visualizations especially if it can help convey more information to our audience.\n",

    "We hypothesize that while headshot percentage positively correlates with win rates across all regions, the strength of this relationship will vary across different regions and their playstyles. We further hypothesize that agent pick rates moderate this relationship, such that utility-heavy compositions reduce the marginal impact of headshot percentage on team win rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in our background, each of the four regions has different play styles. Our hypothesis is that regions that favor utility-reliant agents (such as EMEA) may show a weaker headshot-win rate correlation compared to regions that play more duelist-heavy “run it down” compositions. Although headshot percentage can be an indicator of a winning team, utility-heavy compositions can also garner kills without relying solely on raw aim, potentially mitigating the impact of headshot percentage differences.

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- > Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project -->\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    " > From the Kaggle website of the first dataset we listed, the author was stated that some of the China stats are missing because Chinese hosted events do not have APIs available for post-game stats. This may lead to underrepresentation from Chinese teams and bias our findings towards patterns from the other regions. To combat this limitation, we will avoid making strong claims about China where data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " > While the dataset contains publicly available professional player names, we will not link their player profile to their private identities as they are not needed for analyses. We will focus more on teams as a whole rather than looking at each player individually.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > From the Kaggle website of the first dataset we listed, the author has also noted that the dataset contains missing values, placeholder team names, and inconsistencies such as two teams having the same team ID. As mentioned earlier, China has missing statistics as APIs are not publicly available. We plan to document any missing data we find and exclude rows where missing values are present.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    " > We plan to clearly label visualizations and document any uncertainties we come across to avoid strong conclusions. For example, if there are regional differences between the Americas and China, we will make sure to clarify whether the statement was based on complete or incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " > When performing data analysis and cleaning, we will make sure our code is well-documented so that others can easily follow along and reproduce our results. For example, since we will be looking at VCT playoff games for the years 2024 and 2025, we will clearly state these filtering decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
