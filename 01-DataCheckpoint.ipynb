    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed and released in 2020 by Riot Games, VALORANT is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter game with 28 agents divided into 4 different roles–duelist, initiator, controller, sentinel–as of February 2026. Players are split into two teams of five and are able to select which “agent” they want to play prior to the start of the game. Each agent has their own unique set of abilities. The goal of the game is to win 13 rounds by attacking and defending your side using gunplay and abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "VALORANT Champion Tour (VCT) is an annual tournament hosted by Riot Games. It features four regional leagues, Americas, EMEA, Pacific, and China. VCT events are divided into regional leagues and international leagues. Regional leagues refer to the four regions as mentioned previously while international leagues refer to Masters or Champions events. In other words, the international leagues consist of top teams that won their regional games and the one team that wins is considered the best team in the world as of that year. Since there are many different levels of tournaments and stages, for this project, we will be focusing on VCT Challengers playoff games from 2024-2025. We decided to leave out games from previous stages since the playoffs stage involves top teams, where winners advance to the grand finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a viewer's perspective, each region has different play styles. Regions like EMEA may play very strategically while other regions like to ‘run it down,’ or in other words, play more aggressively. With 18 unique guns to buy from and 28 different agents to choose from, we thought it would be interesting to explore how headshot rates and agent pick rates affect win percentages across different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "One study that has been done related to our topic is Valorant Analysis: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). As suggested by the title, the author compared the performances between different machine learning models trained on Valorant data. More specifically, they compared these models to determine which is the best at revealing underlying patterns and predicting outcomes in a \"high-stakes gaming environment.\" The author used a Kaggle dataset on a player's first 1000 Valorant games (not their own games). They performed basic EDA and created data visualizations to understand visual patterns across different variables like agent pick distributions, rank distribution, map frequency, wins/losses, and KDA (kills, deaths, assists) metrics. Afterwards, they trained an XGB (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model and an RF (Random Forest) model. When comparing metrics&mdash;accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, class 0 performance, weight average&mdash;between the two models, they found that the RF model performed slightly better in terms of precision and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study, titled Valorant VCT Challengers 2024 Analysis, has actually been done on a dataset we may consider using<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The author first preprocessed the data by renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values. Going into EDA, they looked into region and agent distribution, and then they visualized selected columns as a density histogram. Afterward, they looked into the top 1% of players with the highest rating in the tournament and top 1% of agents played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last study we were able to find related to our topic is the VCT 2024 Agent Composition Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This analysis has also been done on a different dataset we consider using for this project. The author preprocessed their data through feature engineering, renaming columns, and did some basic exploration where they looked at descriptive summary statistics for: number of matches played per tournament, stage distribution, match type distribution, and number of matches played per map. They also visualized win rates between agent picks, maps, and they applied a regression model to see if meta agent picks have an impact on win probability and a prediction model on whether map and agent pick influences win probability. Lastly, they created a recommendation list of agents based on win rate and pick rate for each map, which was very interesting to look at.\n",

    "We hypothesize that teams with higher average headshot percentages will have higher win rates in VCT playoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned previously, each region may select different agents based on their playstyles and buy different guns. With these differences in mind, it is likely that headshot and agent pick may vary between regions despite the current game meta. Sometimes there are not many situations where you can solely rely on utility, emphasizing the importance of good aim and, ultimately, headshot rate. Agents such as Veto, whose abilities can destroy utility, or agents like Tejo, Iso, and Kay/O, who have abilities that can suppress utility, enemy players are forced to work around temporary restrictions that can occur within a round."

Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    " > From the Kaggle website of the first dataset we listed, the author was stated that some of the China stats are missing because Chinese hosted events do not have APIs available for post-game stats. This may lead to underrepresentation from Chinese teams and bias our findings towards patterns from the other regions. To combat this limitation, we will avoid making strong claims about China where data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " > While the dataset contains publicly available professional player names, we will not link their player profile to their private identities as they are not needed for analyses. We will focus more on teams as a whole rather than looking at each player individually.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > From the Kaggle website of the first dataset we listed, the author has also noted that the dataset contains missing values, placeholder team names, and inconsistencies such as two teams having the same team ID. As mentioned earlier, China has missing statistics as APIs are not publicly available. We plan to document any missing data we find and exclude rows where missing values are present.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    " > We plan to clearly label visualizations and document any uncertainties we come across to avoid strong conclusions. For example, if there are regional differences between the Americas and China, we will make sure to clarify whether the statement was based on complete or incomplete data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    " > When performing data analysis and cleaning, we will make sure our code is well-documented so that others can easily follow along and reproduce our results. For example, since we will be looking at VCT playoff games for the years 2024 and 2025, we will clearly state these filtering decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
