    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed and released in 2020 by Riot Games, VALORANT is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter game with 28 playable agents divided into 4 different roles–duelist, initiator, controller, sentinel–as of February 2026. Players select “agents” prior to the start of the match, with teams switching between attacking and defending “sites” halfway through the game. “Site” refers to an area on the map where the attacking team needs to plant the objective, otherwise known as the “spike,” and the defending team needs to prevent it from being planted or defuse it before it explodes after a certain amount of time. “Agents” are playable characters, each with unique abilities that complement the different roles: \n",
    "- Duelists: Excel at “entry fragging.” Basically, they are agents that are best known for initial fights and entering sites. Their abilities are often movement abilities or defensive utilities meant for getting kills to help their team enter the site and plant the bomb.\n",
    "- Initiators: Information gatherers. These agents' utilities help their team find where the enemies are positioning or even hiding. Additionally, their kit comes with abilities that help the team further fight enemies at an advantage, such as flashes or stuns. Flashing refers to blinding enemies, and stunning refers to a short debuff that impairs movement, gunfire rate, and shaky camera movement for the player to simulate dizziness. Both of these factors may increase a player’s probability of winning a gunfight with their opponent.\n",
    "- Controllers: Strategic agents that utilize their abilities to assist teammates and manipulate the battlefield, which involves the map, enemy positions, and actions. These abilities include walls and smokes, which help block out enemies and help their team take space on site. Walls and smokes are temporary barriers that block the enemy’s line of sight, but not a solid barrier, so they can still walk through them or enemies can also wait for them to disappear after a certain amount of time.\n",
    "- Sentinels: Site defenders and bombsite anchors. Sentinels are the agents who help secure the sites for their team. They excel at stalling enemy pushes–whether it be delaying an enemy attack from behind or delaying the enemy team from taking full control of a site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the game is to win 13 rounds by attacking and defending your site using gunplay and abilities. A core mechanic in gunplay is the headshot. While each gun deals a different amount of damage to the head, something unique to Valorant is that when both teams are on equal buy, meaning they have the same amount of money, most guns only require a single bullet to the head to instantly kill an opponent. This makes headshot percentage a key measurement of individual mechanical skill. \n",
    "\n",
    "VALORANT Champion Tour (VCT) is an annual tournament hosted by Riot Games. It features four regional leagues, Americas, EMEA, Pacific, and China. VCT events are divided into regional leagues and international leagues. Regional leagues refer to the four regions as mentioned previously while international leagues refer to Masters or Champions events. In other words, the international leagues consist of top teams that won their regional games and the one team that wins is considered the best team in the world as of that year. Since there are many different levels of tournaments and stages, for this project, we will be focusing on VCT Challengers playoff games from 2024-2025. We decided to leave out games from previous stages since the playoffs stage involves top teams, where winners advance to the grand finals.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a viewer's perspective, each region has different play styles. Regions like EMEA may play very strategically while other regions like to ‘run it down,’ or in other words, play more aggressively. With 18 unique guns to buy from and 28 different agents to choose from, we thought it would be interesting to explore how headshot rates and agent pick rates affect win percentages across different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "This research matters because VCT playoffs represent the highest level of competitive Valorant. The prize pools for these international events exceed a million dollars annually. With any kind of sport, successful teams will attract huge sponsorship deals and brand partners. Understanding certain features that establish a successful team can help improve future games and coaching decisions. It might even shine light on any adjustments necessary for improving game balance by showing us whether certain playstyles or agents have a possible disproportionate competitive advantage. In addition, regional playstyle differences may reveal how gameplay is tied to cultural differences and practice environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "One study that has been done related to our topic is Valorant Analysis: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). As suggested by the title, the author compared the performances between different machine learning models trained on Valorant data. More specifically, they compared these models to determine which is the best at revealing underlying patterns and predicting outcomes in a \"high-stakes gaming environment.\" The author used a Kaggle dataset on a player's first 1000 Valorant games (not their own games). They performed basic EDA and created data visualizations to understand visual patterns across different variables like agent pick distributions, rank distribution, map frequency, wins/losses, and KDA (kills, deaths, assists) metrics. Afterwards, they trained an XGB (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model and an RF (Random Forest) model. When comparing metrics&mdash;accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, class 0 performance, weight average&mdash;between the two models, they found that the RF model performed slightly better in terms of precision and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study, titled Valorant VCT Challengers 2024 Analysis, has actually been done on a dataset we may consider using<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The author first preprocessed the data by renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values. Going into EDA, they looked into region and agent distribution, and then they visualized selected columns as a density histogram. Afterward, they looked into the top 1% of players with the highest rating in the tournament and top 1% of agents played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last study we were able to find related to our topic is the VCT 2024 Agent Composition Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This analysis has also been done on a different dataset we consider using for this project. The author preprocessed their data through feature engineering, renaming columns, and did some basic exploration where they looked at descriptive summary statistics for: number of matches played per tournament, stage distribution, match type distribution, and number of matches played per map. They also visualized win rates between agent picks, maps, and they applied a regression model to see if meta agent picks have an impact on win probability and a prediction model on whether map and agent pick influences win probability. Lastly, they created a recommendation list of agents based on win rate and pick rate for each map, which was very interesting to look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the three studies mentioned above explores individual performance and agent compositions separately. None have examined how the interactions between mechanical skill (headshot percentage) and strategic choices (agent compositions) vary across the different regions in VCT. Additionally, the existing studies primarily focus on descriptive analysis rather than predictive modeling and do not specifically analyze any regional playstyle differences. Our project differs from other studies as it:\n",
    "1. Examines the interaction between headshot percentage and agent picks\n",
    "2. Compares how results vary across the four major VCT regions and to what extent\n",
    "3. Uses playoff data from two consecutive years\n",
    "\n",
    "A limitation we found from the first prior work is related to the dataset they used for analysis. From Kaggle, they used a dataset titled My First 1000 Valorant Games, where the dataset author used the data gathered from their own account. With that said, the analyses that were done in the article are not generalizable to the Valorant population as the machine learning models were applied to analyze one player’s account out of millions of others. They also did not explain how their findings were important and focused more on how the models they used differed from one another in terms of metrics. It was also a bit unclear what variables were being used as inputs for the machine learning, especially more so if you do not know how to read code. We will address this kind of limitation by being clear about information that might be missing from our dataset and how they affect our conclusion findings, and also creating markdown cells to explain our work in detail so our reader does not feel lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation can be found in the second prior work, where their data visualization in comparing 4 different columns–rating, KAST (kills, assists, survived, traded), headshot percentage, clutch success percentage–overlaps one another. This makes the graph hard for the reader to interpret even when there’s a short caption explaining all but one plot appears normally distributed. We would address this type of limitation in our project by making sure our plots are easily understandable and so we can reduce cognitive overload.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last limitation we found is in the third study, which also relates to some of their data visualizations. For example, when looking into the win rates per agent, the author chose to give their bar graph a diverging color scheme when it is unnecessary. This is considered a limitation because it may contribute to cognitive overload since the colors do not provide any significant meaning. The interpretation of the graph would be the same if all the bars were one single color. This color scheme is more suited for visualizations such as a correlation heatmap, which is a graph they do have in their study. But for a bar graph, a diverging color scheme is not needed. We will address this type of limitation in our project by using colors wisely in our data visualizations especially if it can help convey more information to our audience.\n",

    "We hypothesize that while headshot percentage positively correlates with win rates across all regions, the strength of this relationship will vary across different regions and their playstyles. We further hypothesize that agent pick rates moderate this relationship, such that utility-heavy compositions reduce the marginal impact of headshot percentage on team win rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in our background, each of the four regions has different play styles. Our hypothesis is that regions that favor utility-reliant agents (such as EMEA) may show a weaker headshot-win rate correlation compared to regions that play more duelist-heavy “run it down” compositions. Although headshot percentage can be an indicator of a winning team, utility-heavy compositions can also garner kills without relying solely on raw aim, potentially mitigating the impact of headshot percentage differences."

    "Key variables from this dataset are ``pick rate``, ``headshot_percentage``, ``agent``, ``map``, ``outcome``, and ``match_result``. Pick rate is a strong indicator of an agent’s popularity among Valorant players. While it may not automatically mean a higher win rate, it can indicate a comfort pick for certain players since teams have preferences for their desired agents over others. It is also significant to note which side an agent is on because that can determine when specific agents are better used. Headshot percentage is a key stat to analyze with context, as some agents are better utilized for attack compared to defense and vice versa. Thus, the outcome can be explained as to why headshot percentages are higher for agents on a particular side. The map provides information on the kind of battlefield used for every match in the dataset. Knowing the names of the agents is crucial for understanding the value they bring to the battlefield. This ties to the pick rates because different playstyles fit each agent. Lastly, variables related to match wins, such as ``outcome`` and ``match_result``, are the most important statistics for our project since they are connected to whether teams win/lose rounds and ultimately the game as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "From reading the data shown on this dataset, it is important to note the key limitations that this dataset presents. The first concern to address is the missing stats from matches played in China. This can be attributed to Chinese-hosted events not having APIs (Application Programming Interface) available for post-game statistics. Thus, multiple variables from Chinese-hosted events are missing and cannot be used for analysis. However, there are still missing values even when events are not hosted in China. This may be due to how events play out during the game. For example, null values may appear in a “2k” column, representing a player getting 2 kills, because it is possible for that player to not get 2 kills in one round. Another instance may include null values for “Overtime Scores” because it is possible for a match to not go into overtime. To go into overtime in Valorant means that the score is 12-12 and one team must win 2 consecutive rounds in a row in order to win (e.g a team will win the entire game if the match score is 14-12). "

    "\n",
    "This dataset includes statistics for both matches and players from the Valorant Champion Tour (or VCT) in 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main variables are ``rating``, a score meant to rate performance where values above a 1.0 mean a positive performance, ``average combat score (ACS)``, that indicates overall combat effectiveness, and ``kill/death ratio (K/D)``, a ratio for kills to deaths and can be used to indicate overall consistency. There are multiple variables that are measured per round, this includes ``kills per round``, ``assists per round``, and ``average damage per round``. All these variables can help outline the amount of value a player can be expected to provide in a round. Variables that are measured in percentages include ``headshot percentage`` which is the percent of shots they fired that resulted in a headshot, ``clutch success percentage`` or the percent of rounds won when the player is the last one of their team alive, and ``kills, assists, survived, traded`` (KAST) which measures a players contribution, beyond just kills, in rounds. The ``agent`` variable is recorded as a list per player, which may allow us to see whether certain regions favor certain agents and the overall ``pick rate percentage``, or percentage of games where an agent is played, can help indicate which agents are simply favored in general, perhaps due to any advantages they might've had in that state of the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations that should be considered when reading this data. One major concern that was previously mentioned is that of missing data, especially for players from China, where several variables such as their rating, headshot percentage, KAST, and damage per round are missing. Again, this is due to the fact that such API data is not made available when it comes to games from the region, and it may create bias for comparisons. The data is also limited to players in playoffs, meaning it represents high-level players rather than the overall Valorant player base. As a result, findings may not translate perfectly to lower-ranked or casual, play. There is also the fact that agent pick rates are combined across all contexts, meaning it is done without taking into account the maps played on, specific team strategies, or any roles the players or agents specialize in, which may blur relationships between agent choice, headshot percentage, and win rates."

The information analyze how a team's headshot accuracy might correlate with their match outcomes, or win rate. \n",

Differences in win rates or team composition between these seasons may due to game updates, balance changes, or meta shifts, these may be reflected in terms of numbers on the data but not explicitly stated so it would require further research.
