    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Developed and released in 2020 by Riot Games, VALORANT is a free-to-play 5v5 tactical shooter game with 28 agents divided into 4 different roles–duelist, initiator, controller, sentinel–as of February 2026. Players are split into two teams of five and are able to select which “agent” they want to play prior to the start of the game. Each agent has their own unique set of abilities. The goal of the game is to win 13 rounds by attacking and defending your side using gunplay and abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "VALORANT Champion Tour (VCT) is an annual tournament hosted by Riot Games. It features four regional leagues, Americas, EMEA, Pacific, and China. VCT events are divided into regional leagues and international leagues. Regional leagues refer to the four regions as mentioned previously while international leagues refer to Masters or Champions events. In other words, the international leagues consist of top teams that won their regional games and the one team that wins is considered the best team in the world as of that year. Since there are many different levels of tournaments and stages, for this project, we will be focusing on VCT Challengers playoff games from 2024-2025. We decided to leave out games from previous stages since the playoffs stage involves top teams. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, we wanted to explore how headshot percentages and agent pick rates affect win percentages across different regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "One study that has been done related to our topic is Valorant Analysis: A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1). As suggested by the title, the author compared the performances between different machine learning models trained on Valorant data. More specifically, they compared these models to determine which is the best at revealing underlying patterns and predicting outcomes in a \"high-stakes gaming environment.\" The author used a Kaggle dataset on a player's first 1000 Valorant games (not their own games). They performed basic EDA and created data visualizations to understand visual patterns across different variables like agent pick distributions, rank distribution, map frequency, wins/losses, and KDA (kills, deaths, assists) metrics. Afterwards, they trained an XGB (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) model and an RF (Random Forest) model. When comparing metrics&mdash;accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, class 0 performance, weight average&mdash;between the two models, they found that the RF model performed slightly better in terms of precision and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study, titled Valorant VCT Challengers 2024 Analysis, has actually been done on a dataset we may consider using<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The author first preprocessed the data by renaming columns, converting data types, and handling missing values. Going into EDA, they looked into region and agent distribution, and then they visualized selected columns as a density histogram. Afterward, they looked into the top 1% of players with the highest rating in the tournament and top 1% of agents played.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last study we were able to find related to our topic is the VCT 2024 Agent Composition Analysis<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). This analysis has also been done on a different dataset we consider using for this project. The author preprocessed their data through feature engineering, renaming columns, and did some basic exploration where they looked at descriptive summary statistics for: number of matches played per tournament, stage distribution, match type distribution, and number of matches played per map. They also visualized win rates between agent picks, maps, and they applied a regression model to see if meta agent picks have an impact on win probability and a prediction model on whether map and agent pick influences win probability. Lastly, they created a recommendation list of agents based on win rate and pick rate for each map, which was very interesting to look at.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that teams with higher average headshot percentages will have higher win rates in VCT playoffs.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a viewer's perspective, each region has different play styles. Regions like EMEA may play very strategically while other regions like to ‘run it down,’ or in other words, their playstyles are more aggressive. This potentially means that despite the current game meta, each region will select different agents based on their play styles and different guns as well. With these differences in mind, it is likely that headshot and agent pick may vary between regions.\n"

    "The ideal dataset would need the following variables to answer our question:\n",
    "- headshot percentage\n",
    "- region labels\n",
    "- agent pick rates\n",
    "- match outcome\n",
    "- map played\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be best for our data to be organized in tabular format and stored as a csv file, and more importantly, that our data is found through source(s) that have publicly available esports stats. To make reasonable analyses, we think that having at least 1000 VCT playoff observations would be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Kaggle dataset, [Valorant Champion Tour 2021-2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanluong1/valorant-champion-tour-2021-2023-data?select=vct_2025), is one we are strongly considering as it may potentially provide us all the information we need to carry out this project. This dataset has been collected by web scraping off of [vlr.gg](https://www.vlr.gg/), a website that updates the community of the esports side of VALORANT. Not only does it contain information on esports schedules, forums and news, but it also collects data&mdash;match results, team stats&mdash; from real games, which is what we are looking for. Additionally, since the author of the dataset was able to collect data from the past 4 years of VCT, it can also be used to look at how trends have changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are many different folders&mdash;``agents``, ``ids``, ``matches``, ``players_stats``&mdash;to look into for this dataset, we may need to do a lot of data merging between files. Some of the variables in this dataset we may use include:\n",
    "- ``Pick Rate``\n",
    "- ``Headshot %``\n",
    "- ``Average Combat Score``\n",
    "- ``Outcome`` (win/loss a round)\n",
    "- ``Match Result`` (win/loss of the overall game)\n",
    "- ``Stage``\n",
    "- ``Teams``\n",
    "- ``Agents``\n",
    "- ``Map`` (since map pool changes per year)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another potential Kaggle dataset we can use is titled [Valorant Champions Tour 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sauurabhkr/valorant-champions-tour-2024). The dataset would be good for looking into individual player performance across 3 different VCT tiers (VCT International, VCT Challengers, and VCT Game Changers) and comparing statistics across competitive regions. Should we decide to focus on only one year's worth of VCT data, we may consider using this dataset. However, we would also have to tweak our research question slightly since this dataset mainly includes player statistics from the 3 tiers and less on the overall outcome of the match played (i.e which team won and by how many rounds). While the dataset can be publicly found on Kaggle, it has not been specifically stated where the data was collected from. The data has been stored as 3 separate JSON files, but should not be a problem to import since the pandas library can read in dataframes from different file formats. We would most likely use the following variables for analysis:\n",
    "- ``region``\n",
    "- ``headshot_percentage``\n",
    "- ``agent``\n",
    "- ``playerCategory`` (which VCT tier they belong to)\n",
    "- ``team``\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The last Kaggle dataset we considered is the [Valorant VCT Champions 2025 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kierru/valorant-vct-champions-2025-dataset). Like the first dataset, the data has been collected from [vlr.gg](https://www.vlr.gg/), but also similar to the previous dataset in which the data only covers VCT 2025 and not from previous years. This dataset has multiple csv files that allow for different analytic approaches such as looking into esports analytics, performance analysis, or predicting match outcomes. Some variables that could be used for our analysis include:\n",
    "- ``team_id``, ``name`` (of team)\n",
    "- ``match_id``\n",
    "- ``agent``\n",
    "- ``game_id``\n",
    "- ``team_1_wl`` (whether a team won/lost)\n",
    "- ``team_1_ct``, ``team_1_t``, ``team_1_ot``\n",
    "- ``country``"
